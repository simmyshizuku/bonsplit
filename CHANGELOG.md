# Changelog

All notable changes to Bonsplit will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `BonsplitController.addPaneWithAutoLayout(from:withTab:)` adds a pane and retiles all panes in
  Zellij's default layout: the right column fills to four panes before a new column opens.
- Pane focus memory. `navigateFocus(direction:)` and `adjacentPane(to:direction:)` return the most
  recently focused pane that shares the requested edge, so moving across an edge and back returns to
  the origin pane. Closing the focused pane returns to the most recently used remaining pane.
- `BonsplitConfiguration.Appearance.tabWidthMode` (`TabWidthMode`) to control tab sizing.
  - `.fixed` (default) keeps the historical fixed-width + horizontal-scroll layout unchanged.
  - `.fill` stretches tabs to fill the pane's available tab-bar width, distributing the
    space equally; a single tab spans the full width. Tabs fall back to fixed sizing and
    scroll when they would overflow at their natural width.
- Pinned browser tabs (`kind == "browser"` with `isPinned == true`) now collapse to an
  icon-only chip (favicon only) sized to a compact fixed width, mirroring pinned tabs in
  macOS browsers. The full title stays available via the tab tooltip and accessibility
  label. A small corner badge preserves audio / unread / dirty activity signals (the
  audio badge stays click-to-mute via the existing `.toggleAudioMute` route), and the
  control-shortcut number hint still appears (crossfading over the favicon on
  modifier-hold) with its width reserved so the tab never resizes. Pinned terminal (and
  other non-browser) tabs keep their titled layout.

### Fixed
- A tab title change no longer re-renders the whole tab bar. `TabItem` is now a
  reference type, so writing one tab's title touches that object instead of the
  `@Observable` `PaneState.tabs` array, and observation delivers the change to
  the one `TabItemView` that reads the title. Inserting, removing, and moving
  tabs still publish through `tabs`. Equality and hashing were already by `id`,
  so identity comparisons are unaffected.
- Split-button icons no longer re-resolve their SF Symbol on every tab bar body
  evaluation. `TabBarStyling.splitActionSystemImage(for:)` tested whether a name
  was a real symbol by allocating an `NSImage` and discarding it, which cost
  ~27µs per call and ran once per button per evaluation. Results are now
  memoized by name, which the symbol catalog makes safe: the answer cannot
  change while the process runs.

## [1.1.1] - 2025-01-29

### Fixed
- Fixed delegate notifications not being sent when closing tabs ([#2](https://github.com/almonk/bonsplit/issues/2))
  - Tabs now correctly communicate through `BonsplitController` for proper delegate callbacks

### Added
- New public method `closeTab(_ tabId: TabID, inPane paneId: PaneID) -> Bool` for efficient tab closing when pane is known

## [1.1.0] - 2025-01-26

### Added

#### Two-Way Synchronization API
- **Geometry Query**: Query pane layout with pixel coordinates for integration with external programs
  - `layoutSnapshot()` - Get flat list of pane geometries with pixel coordinates
  - `treeSnapshot()` - Get full tree structure for external consumption
  - `findSplit(_:)` - Check if a split exists by UUID

- **Programmatic Updates**: Control divider positions from external sources
  - `setDividerPosition(_:forSplit:fromExternal:)` - Set divider position with loop prevention
  - `setContainerFrame(_:)` - Update container frame when window moves/resizes

- **Geometry Notifications**: Receive callbacks when geometry changes
  - `didChangeGeometry` delegate callback - Notified when any pane geometry changes
  - `shouldNotifyDuringDrag` delegate callback - Opt-in to real-time notifications during divider drag

#### New Types
- `LayoutSnapshot` - Full tree snapshot with pixel coordinates and timestamp
- `PixelRect` - Pixel rectangle for external consumption (Codable, Sendable)
- `PaneGeometry` - Geometry for a single pane including frame and tab info
- `ExternalTreeNode` - Recursive tree representation (enum: pane or split)
- `ExternalPaneNode` - Pane node for external consumption
- `ExternalSplitNode` - Split node with orientation and divider position
- `ExternalTab` - Tab info for external consumption

#### Debug Tools
- Debug window in Example app for testing synchronization features

## [1.0.0] - Initial Release

### Added
- Tab bar with drag-and-drop reordering
- Horizontal and vertical split panes
- 120fps animations
- Configurable appearance and behavior
- Delegate callbacks for all tab and pane events
- Keyboard navigation between panes
- Content view lifecycle options (recreateOnSwitch, keepAllAlive)
- Configuration presets (default, singlePane, readOnly)
